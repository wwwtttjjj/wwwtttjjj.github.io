## 👋 About Me

**Tengjin Weng** (he/him)  
PhD Student in Computer Science  
**Shenzhen University**, China 🇨🇳  

My research focuses on **medical image analysis**, **semi-supervised learning**, and **multimodal reasoning**, with an emphasis on **annotation ambiguity**, **pseudo-label robustness**, and **efficient supervision**. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that are both practical and reliable in real-world clinical settings.
